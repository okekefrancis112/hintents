# soroban-env-host major version == Soroban protocol version.
# Protocol 21 (v21.x) introduced DiagnosticLevel, get_events(), and the
# HostedContractEvent.failed_call field that this simulator relies on.
# We accept any release in the 21-25 range so the binary stays compatible
# with both mainnet protocol 21 and subsequent minor protocol bumps.
