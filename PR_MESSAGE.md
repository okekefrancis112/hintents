Note: In the codespace container I could not run tests because `jest` is not installed in the environment (command `jest: not found`). Running `npm ci` locally will install the dev dependencies and allow the test run.
# PR Title
Refactor config lifecycle into parse/default/validate phases

## Summary
- split configuration loading into lifecycle phases: parsing, default assignment, and validation
- introduced interface-based validators so each validation rule is isolated
- added unit tests for missing required fields, invalid types, and out-of-bounds timeout values

## Validation
- `go test ./internal/config -count=1`
