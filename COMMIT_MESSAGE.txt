feat(metrics): expose remote node response staleness in Prometheus exports

Add comprehensive Prometheus metrics for monitoring remote node health
and enabling staleness alerting in the ERST daemon.

New metrics:
- remote_node_last_response_timestamp_seconds: Unix timestamp of last
  successful response per node (enables staleness detection)
- remote_node_response_total: Total responses by status (success/error)
- remote_node_response_duration_seconds: Request duration histogram
- simulation_execution_total: Total simulation executions by status

All metrics are labeled by node_address and network for granular
monitoring. The timestamp metric only updates on successful responses,
enabling reliable staleness detection via:
  time() - remote_node_last_response_timestamp_seconds > 60

Implementation:
- Created internal/metrics package with Prometheus metric definitions
- Exposed /metrics endpoint in daemon server at :8080/metrics
- Integrated metric recording in RPC client for remote node calls
- Integrated metric recording in simulator runner for executions
- Added comprehensive documentation and verification guides
- Included unit and integration tests

Metrics are automatically recorded for:
- Horizon API calls (GetTransaction)
- Soroban RPC calls (GetLedgerEntries)
- All simulation executions

Documentation:
- docs/PROMETHEUS_METRICS.md: Full guide with PromQL queries and alerts
- docs/METRICS_VERIFICATION.md: Step-by-step verification guide
- docs/METRICS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md: Quick reference for DevOps
- internal/metrics/README.md: Package documentation

Example alert configuration:
  alert: RemoteNodeStale
  expr: time() - remote_node_last_response_timestamp_seconds > 60
  for: 1m

Files changed:
- go.mod: Added prometheus/client_golang dependency
- internal/metrics/: New package (4 files, ~475 lines)
- internal/daemon/server.go: Added /metrics endpoint
- internal/simulator/runner.go: Added execution metrics
- internal/rpc/client.go: Added remote node metrics
- docs/: Added 3 documentation files (~1,150 lines)
